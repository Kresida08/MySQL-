#Differnce between Table and Database.
Database = collection of tables.
Table = collection of rows & columns.
You create a database first, then create tables inside it.

#What is Varchar? 
VARCHAR stands for Variable Character. It is a data type used to store text (strings).
varchar (n)
CODE:- Name varchar (50)
->Can store names up to 50 characters
->Saves space (uses only required memory)
Here, n = Maximum number of Character

#What is Char?
CHAR means Fixed-length Character.
Stores text of fixed size,
Always uses the same memory,
Faster but wastes space,
Best for fixed values like gender, country code.

#What is Primary Key?
A Primary Key is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
🔹 Key Features:
-> Must be unique (no duplicate values).
-> Cannot be NULL.
-> Only one Primary Key per table.
-> Ensures data integrity.
